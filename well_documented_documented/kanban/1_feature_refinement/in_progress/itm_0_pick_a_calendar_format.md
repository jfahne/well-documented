## Stakeholder Context <!-- Required -->

An end user of this project looking to contribute or understand the project's roadmap wants a view
into the timelines for features. Maintainers want a way to track if an assignee for a feature is
delaying the project.

## Technical Context <!-- Required -->

This project is built around all aspects of a project being documented in plain text formats.
Having a project's timeline documented should serve as an enrichment on the existing git
history. A calendar format should surface future work and dependency management and lean on
the VCS for historical records.
